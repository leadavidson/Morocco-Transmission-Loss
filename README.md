# Morocco-Transmission-Loss
Data repository for continuous temperature monitoring within near-surface sediments in central Morocco.
Pendant temperature measurements are reported in Â°F. Pendant A represents the shallowest pendant within each transect, increasing with depth alphabetically. Data is truncated to remove four days following inital installation to allow for sensor stabilization. Transects which end prematurely represent instances of sensor battery failure.
